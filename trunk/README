Tinapt V0.1a

This program is not yet ready for use. Do not use this program in it's current state unless you know what you are doing since it's quite possible that it will brake your system.

Tinapt does not yet support 'apt-listbugs'. The program will hang if apt-listbugs is installed and there are registered bugs on some of the packages about to be upgraded/ installed.

There is no installer yet. To run just make 'tinapt' and 'tinaptMainProg.py' executable (chmod +x) or copy all files to a directory that is already in your PATH. Execute 'tinapt' to run the program.
